For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements.

For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

Therefore, you should not assign its result to a variable.\n3. **Best Practice:** To correctly use the `sort` method, call it directly on the array you want to sort without assigning its result to a variable. This ensures that the original array is sorted without any type conflicts. Remember, understanding the return type of methods is crucial for proper usage in Java.",

In this case, you need to assign a lambda expression to the `binaryOperator` field within the `Operator` class.\n3. **Best Practice:** When working with functional interfaces and lambda expressions in Java, always make sure to provide a valid implementation for the functional method defined in the interface. This ensures that the lambda expression can be executed correctly when invoked.\n4. **Additional Tip:** Remember that static fields are shared across all instances of a class, so initializing them properly is crucial to avoid runtime errors like `NullPointerException`.",

This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```"

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope.

For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

The internal analysis incorrectly identifies the issue as not utilizing f-strings correctly, which is not the problem indicated by the system feedback. The actual problem seems to be related to the function being called twice or a misunderstanding in how the output is being evaluated.\n4. The user-facing feedback focuses on advising the use of f-strings for formatting, which, while being a good practice, does not address the specific error of the output being printed twice.\n5. The criterion requires the feedback to highlight specific errors in the student's code and provide actionable advice to correct these errors.

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For example, use `a = int(input())` instead of `a = int(input)`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Proper syntax is crucial in Python programming. Make sure to pay attention to details like parentheses, quotation marks, and colons to avoid common syntax errors that can impact the functionality of your code. Remember, small syntax mistakes can lead to runtime errors, so always double-check your code for accuracy.",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For example, to check if string 'b' is in string 'a', you should use `print(b in a)` instead of `print(a in b)`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Understanding the correct order of variables in Python operators is essential for accurate results.

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope.

This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

Therefore, you should not assign its result to a variable.\n3. **Best Practice:** To correctly use the `sort` method, call it directly on the array you want to sort without assigning its result to a variable. This ensures that the original array is sorted without any type conflicts. Remember, understanding the return type of methods is crucial for proper usage in Java.",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

Let's break down the user-facing feedback provided to see if it meets this criterion:\n\n1. **Issue Identified:** The feedback clearly identifies the issue in the student's code, stating that the `setFlag` method only returns the current value of the `flag` without updating it. This is straightforward and directly addresses the problem without using overly technical language.\n\n2. **Actionable Advice:** The feedback suggests using the `compareAndSet` method of the `AtomicBoolean` class to atomically set the value of the `flag`. While the term \"atomically\" might be new to a complete beginner, the advice is actionable because it specifies the method to use. However, the explanation could be slightly intimidating for someone with no experience, as it assumes familiarity with concepts like atomic operations and shared variables.\n\n3. **Best Practice:** The feedback encourages reviewing documentation and understanding atomic operations to prevent race conditions. This advice is sound but might be slightly advanced for a complete beginner. The concepts of race conditions and atomic operations are not trivial for someone new to programming.\n\nOverall, the feedback is structured in a clear and list-based format, which aids in readability. However, the use of terms like \"atomically,\" \"race conditions,\" and \"data consistency\" without further explanation could potentially confuse a complete beginner.

This method allows you to perform the update conditionally and atomically.\n3. **Best Practice:** When working with shared variables in concurrent programming, always ensure that you use appropriate atomic operations to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. Review the documentation for `AtomicBoolean` and understand how methods like `compareAndSet` can help achieve the desired behavior.",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

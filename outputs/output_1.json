Instead of using nested if-else statements, you can use elif to make the code cleaner and easier to read. \n\nLastly, remember to follow best coding practices by using meaningful variable names and adding comments to explain your code. \n\nKeep practicing and you'll improve your coding skills!",

          "output": "It seems like you are getting a runtime error because the variable 'word' is not defined in your code. The correct way to get the film title input from the user is to use the 'input()' function and store it in a variable like 'film_title'. Then you can use the 'upper()' function to convert the film title to all caps.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should replace 'word' with 'film_title' in your code. Remember to always define variables before using them in your code to avoid errors. Keep practicing and you'll get the hang of it!",

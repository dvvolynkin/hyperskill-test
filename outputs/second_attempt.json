This indicates a lack of understanding of data types and type conversion in Python.\n\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** In Python, the 'input()' function returns a string, not an integer. Therefore, comparing it directly with integers like 'a', 'b', and 'h' will not yield the correct results.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** To convert the input strings to integers, you can use the 'int()' function. For example, you can modify your code like this: `a = int(input())`, `b = int(input())`, `h = int(input())`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always ensure that you convert user input to the appropriate data type before performing any comparisons or calculations to avoid unexpected behavior in your program. Understanding data types and type conversion is essential for writing robust Python code.",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

The feedback should also encourage best coding practices in a manner simple enough for an adult programming novice.\n\n1. **Error Identification**: The feedback correctly identifies that the student's code prompts the user to enter values for 'n' and 'k' separately with additional text, which does not match the expected input format. This is a specific error identified based on the system's output and the submitted code.\n\n2. **Actionable Advice**: The feedback provides actionable advice by suggesting the student update their code to accept input in the format specified in the problem statement. However, it inaccurately advises to read both values in a single line separated by a space, which is not actually required or indicated by the correct solution or the problem statement. The problem statement and the correct solution simply require reading two inputs consecutively without specifying they should be on the same line or separated by a space. The actual issue in the student's code is the unnecessary text prompts in the input function, which could interfere with automated testing systems expecting a specific output format.\n\n3. **Best Practices**: The feedback encourages following the input data format guidelines provided in the problem statement, which is a good practice. However, the advice given does not accurately address the problem in the student's submission related to the format of the input.\n\n4. **Criterion Match**: The feedback does not fully meet the criterion because it misinterprets the specific error in the student's code regarding input handling.

This method simplifies string formatting and makes the code more readable. You can achieve this by placing an 'f' before the opening quotation mark of the string and enclosing variables in curly braces within the string.\n3. **Best Practice:** Embracing f-string formatting not only enhances the clarity of your code but also reduces the chances of errors related to string concatenation.

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

This method allows you to perform the update conditionally.\n3. **Best Practice:** When working with shared variables in concurrent programming, always use atomic operations like `compareAndSet` to ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions.

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

This will prevent the program from crashing and allow you to handle errors gracefully.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always anticipate and handle potential exceptions in your code to ensure robustness and prevent unexpected crashes.

It is used for replacing substrings based on regular expressions. This indicates a misunderstanding of the appropriate method to use for character replacement.\n\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** In Java, the `replaceAll` method is used for replacing substrings based on regular expressions, not individual characters. You should use the `replace` method to replace specific characters in a string.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Replace `replaceAll` with `replace` in your code to correctly replace individual characters in the string. For example, use `String output = input.replace('a', 'b');` to replace all occurrences of the letter 'a' with 'b'.\n3. **Best Practice:** Understanding the differences between `replaceAll` and `replace` methods in Java is essential for accurately manipulating strings. Always refer to the official Java documentation or reliable sources to ensure you are using the correct method for your specific task.",

For instance, include a line such as 'word = input(\"Please enter a word: \")' at the beginning of your script.\n3. **Best Practice:** Always test your program with different inputs to ensure that all variables are properly initialized and used within their scope. This practice helps avoid common errors and improves the reliability of your code.\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'SyntaxError' due to missing colon after an if statement.\n- Issue: The student forgot to put a colon at the end of the if statement, which is crucial for defining block scopes in Python.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** Your if statement is missing a colon at the end, which caused a 'SyntaxError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Remember to add a colon right after the condition in your if statements. This tells Python that you're about to start a block of statements that should only execute under certain conditions.\n3. **Best Practice:** Writing small test cases to check each part of your code incrementally can help catch these types of syntax errors before they affect larger parts of your program.\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\nInternal Analysis:\n- Error: 'IndexError' because the code attempts to access a list index that is out of range.\n- Issue: The student seems unaware of how to properly check the bounds of a list before accessing its elements.\n\n++++++\nUser-Facing Feedback:\n1. **Issue Identified:** You tried to access a list element with an index that exceeds the list's boundaries, leading to an 'IndexError'.\n2. **Actionable Advice:** Always check that your index is within the valid range of the list by comparing it against the length of the list minus one. For example, you can use a condition like `if index < len(my_list):` before accessing `my_list[index]`.\n3. **Best Practice:** Implementing boundary checks for list accesses is a crucial habit that can prevent runtime errors and ensure your program handles data gracefully.\n```",

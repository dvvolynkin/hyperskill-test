However, the provided user code already effectively handles splitting by spaces using `split()`, which by default handles consecutive spaces correctly. This advice, while generally good, is not specifically applicable to the user's code as it already behaves in the described manner.\n\n5.

Therefore, this piece of advice does not encourage best coding practices as it suggests reverting to an older syntax without a clear rationale.\n\n3. The suggestion to modify the \"case\" statements to use a colon \":\" instead of \"->\" is related to the previous point. It advises against using the newer switch expression syntax in favor of the traditional switch statement syntax. This advice does not inherently encourage best coding practices, as both syntaxes are valid and the choice between them should be based on context, readability, and the specific Java version being used.\n\n4. The final piece of advice to adjust the case for \"ravenclaw\" to print \"intellect\" instead of an empty string is actionable and correct. It directly addresses an error in the user's wrong answer, where the output for \"ravenclaw\" is mistakenly left as an empty string.

              "reason": "The submission does not meet the criterion:\n1. The first point of feedback suggests changing \"scanner.next()\" to \"scanner.nextLine()\" to ensure the entire input line is read. This is a valid suggestion because \"scanner.next()\" only reads the next token (up to whitespace), which might not capture the full house name if it includes spaces. However, the task description does not explicitly state that house names will include spaces, and all provided examples (\"gryffindor\", \"hufflepuff\", \"slytherin\", \"ravenclaw\") are single words. Therefore, while \"scanner.nextLine()\" is generally more robust for reading a full line of input, the original code's use of \"scanner.next()\" is not inherently incorrect based on the provided task description and examples.\n\n2. The second and third points of feedback are incorrect because they misunderstand the syntax used in the student's submission. The student used the enhanced switch statement introduced in Java 12, which allows for the use of \"->\" to separate the case label from the code block. This syntax is valid and does not require modification to the older \"case\" and \":\" syntax for the code to function correctly.\n\n3. The fourth point of feedback is correct. The student's code for the \"ravenclaw\" case incorrectly outputs an empty string instead of \"intellect\". This is a specific error in the student's code that directly relates to the task's requirements.\n\nBased on the criterion that the feedback must correctly highlight specific errors in the student's code, the submission partially meets the criterion because only one of the four points of feedback (the fourth point) accurately identifies and corrects a specific error in the student's code. The first point is more of a suggestion than a correction of an error, and the second and third points are based on a misunderstanding of valid Java syntax.\n\nN\n\nN",

This advice is actionable and directly related to the task's goal, promoting best coding practices.\n5. However, the feedback does not correct the logical condition provided by the user, which is incorrect based on the task description. The task requires checking if the first number is between the second and third numbers (inclusive), regardless of their order. The user's condition only checks if the first number is greater than the second and less than or equal to the third, which does not account for the numbers' order or inclusivity correctly.

However, the order of operands in the user's wrong answer is correct for the task of dividing the total number of nuts by the number of squirrels to find out how many nuts each squirrel gets. This part of the feedback does not accurately address an issue in the submission, as the problem with the submission is not the order of operands but rather the inclusion of input prompts that were not required by the task description.\n\n3. The feedback does not address the main issue with the submission, which is the addition of input prompts (\"Enter value of n\", \"Enter value of k\") that lead to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output. The task description does not specify that input prompts should be included, and their presence is what caused the submission to fail the test. Therefore, the feedback misses an opportunity to encourage best coding practices by aligning the submission more closely with the task requirements.\n\n4.

The function should take three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\n2. The student's submission failed because it printed the output twice instead of once, as indicated by the system output: \"Your code output: 3 x + 4 = 3\\n3 x + 4 = 3\".\n\n3. The feedback provided suggests changing the existing print statement to use string formatting to match the desired output format. However, the student's code already uses string formatting (`print(a, 'x +', b, '=', c)`), albeit not in the most concise way (`f\"{a} x + {b} = {c}\"` would be more direct and in line with the correct answer).\n\n4. The feedback does not accurately identify the specific error in the student's code. The actual issue is not with the format of the print statement but with the fact that the function was called twice, leading to two lines of output instead of one. This is evident from the provided code snippet where the function call `equation_writing(3, 4, 3)` appears to be executed as part of the submission, which it should not have been according to the task description.\n\n5. Therefore, the feedback does not correctly highlight the specific error in the student's code, as it fails to mention the actual issue of the function being called within the submission, leading to duplicate output.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\nN\n\nN",

The feedback provided suggests correcting the input reading and updating the sum calculation, which is partially correct.

The feedback also suggests checking the total number of integers to sum (n) and refining the sum condition to consider integers divisible by n.

The first point of feedback suggests changing \"scanner.next()\" to \"scanner.nextLine()\" to ensure the entire input line is read. This is a valid suggestion because \"scanner.next()\" only reads the next token (up to whitespace), which might not capture the full house name if it includes spaces. However, the task description does not explicitly state that house names will include spaces, and all provided examples (\"gryffindor\", \"hufflepuff\", \"slytherin\", \"ravenclaw\") are single words. Therefore, while \"scanner.nextLine()\" is generally more robust for reading a full line of input, the original code's use of \"scanner.next()\" is not inherently incorrect based on the provided task description and examples.\n\n2. The second and third points of feedback are incorrect because they misunderstand the syntax used in the student's submission. The student used the enhanced switch statement introduced in Java 12, which allows for the use of \"->\" to separate the case label from the code block. This syntax is valid and does not require modification to the older \"case\" and \":\" syntax for the code to function correctly.\n\n3. The fourth point of feedback is correct. The student's code for the \"ravenclaw\" case incorrectly outputs an empty string instead of \"intellect\". This is a specific error in the student's code that directly relates to the task's requirements.\n\nBased on the criterion that the feedback must correctly highlight specific errors in the student's code, the submission partially meets the criterion because only one of the four points of feedback (the fourth point) accurately identifies and corrects a specific error in the student's code. The first point is more of a suggestion than a correction of an error, and the second and third points are based on a misunderstanding of valid Java syntax.\n\nN\n\nN",

However, the feedback does not correct the logical condition provided by the user, which is incorrect based on the task description. The task requires checking if the first number is between the second and third numbers (inclusive), regardless of their order.

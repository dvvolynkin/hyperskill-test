Your program should receive 3 numbers in the following order: <code class=\"java\">A</code>, <code class=\"java\">B</code>, <code class=\"java\">H,</code> where <code class=\"java\">A</code> is always less than or equal to <code class=\"java\">B</code>. If Ann follows the program's recommendations, print \"<strong>Normal</strong>\". If she sleeps <strong>less</strong> than A hours, output \"<strong>Deficiency</strong>\", and if she sleeps <strong>more</strong> than B hours, output \"<strong>Excess</strong>\". Ensure the output exactly matches the specified cases (\"Deficiency,\" \"Excess,\" \"Normal\"). Pay attention to strict conditional operators: <span class=\"math-tex\">\\( \\lt \\)</span> and <span class=\"math-tex\">\\( \\le \\)</span>, <span class=\"math-tex\">\\( \\gt \\)</span> and <span class=\"math-tex\">\\( \\ge \\)</span>.

The feedback encourages good coding practices, such as paying attention to variable names and typos.\n\nGiven the above points, the feedback correctly identifies the specific error (use of an undefined variable) but makes an incorrect assumption about the student having defined 'film_title' through input(), which was not part of the student's provided code.

The submission suggests that the student's error is not using f-string formatting and explains the importance of using f-string to correctly insert variables into the string.\n3. However, the student's code does use print statements correctly to output the desired format without explicitly using f-string formatting. The issue in the student's code is not the absence of f-string formatting but rather that the function was called twice, leading to duplicate output.\n4. The feedback provided in the submission does not accurately identify the mistake in the student's code. Instead, it incorrectly points to the lack of f-string formatting as the problem.\n5. For a programming newbie, this feedback might be confusing because it directs attention to an aspect of the code (f-string formatting) that is not the source of the error. The actual error (the function being called twice, leading to duplicate output) is not mentioned.\n6. Therefore, the feedback does not meet the criterion of being easy to understand for a programming newbie with no experience, as it misidentifies the problem and could lead to further confusion.\n\nN\n\nN\n---\nIn your code, you are missing the f-string formatting to properly print the equation in the required format.

The task was to write a program that prints each film title in all caps, which implies taking an input and converting it to uppercase.\n2. The student's code attempted to print a variable in uppercase without defining it first, leading to a NameError.\n3. The feedback correctly identifies the error in the student's code: the use of an undefined variable 'word'.\n4. The feedback suggests using the correct variable name 'film_title' that should be defined by capturing user input, which aligns with the correct approach to solving the task.\n5. However, the feedback incorrectly assumes that the student defined 'film_title' through the input() function, which is not evident in the student's submission. The student's code snippet does not show any variable definition or input capture, only an attempt to print an undefined variable in uppercase.\n6. The feedback provides a hint to fix the issue without giving away the direct solution, which is to ensure the use of correctly defined variable names.\n7. The feedback encourages good coding practices, such as paying attention to variable names and typos.\n\nGiven the above points, the feedback correctly identifies the specific error (use of an undefined variable) but makes an incorrect assumption about the student having defined 'film_title' through input(), which was not part of the student's provided code. Despite this, the essence of the feedback addresses the main issue and provides a constructive hint towards the solution.\n\nN\n\nN\n---\nIn your code, you are trying to print the uppercase version of a variable called 'word', but you have not defined this variable anywhere in your code.

This will allow you to convert the film title to uppercase using the .upper() method.\n\nRemember to always use the variable names that you have defined and pay attention to any typos in your code.

The user's wrong answer does print the equation in the required format but does so twice, which is not mentioned in the feedback provided in the submission.\n3. The feedback incorrectly identifies the problem as missing f-string formatting, which is not the case. The user's code does not use f-string formatting but still produces the correct output format (albeit twice due to an error not related to string formatting).\n4. The correct advice should have focused on why the function's output appeared twice instead of focusing on the string formatting method, which was not the issue.\n5. The submission does not accurately highlight the specific error in the student's code and provides incorrect advice for correction.\n\nN\n\nN",
